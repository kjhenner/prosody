What are the requirements for the next node?
  - meter
      Single-edge metrical fit is independent of path. This could be handled
      three different ways:
        1. As the graph is constructed initially,
        2. After the graph is constructed, as a mutation to the graph,
        3. As the graph is traversed, as a persistent mutation.
      It would be very ineffecient to compute multi-edge metrical fit over
      the whole graph. We don't want to bother calculating this for paths
      that would have a bad single-edge fit. We may also want to consider
      concurrence weight.
      What if we look initially for chains of metrical fit, then attempt to
      stitch them together?
  - rhyme
  - cooccurance weight
  def evaluate_fit(u, v) #Considering rhyme, meter, and weight
  sort edges for best fit
